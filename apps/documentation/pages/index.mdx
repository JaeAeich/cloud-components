The UI package the empowers and enables the design of the GA4GH components. But why just GA4GH? got a custom
implementation of an API? or Maybe you just want to use the components in your own project?
`ecc-utils-design` got you covered.

  <Steps>
    ### Cross-Platform
    React, Vue, Angular or plain old vanilla HTML, the design package is built to be used in any environment.

    ### Customizable
    Don't like out default colors? or maybe you want to change the font? the design package is built to be customized.

    ### Plug and play
    Just import the components and start using them, no need to worry about the underlying logic.
