# Introduction

`@elixir-cloud/wes` package provides a collection of `Web Components` for interacting with
[WES (Workflow Execution Service) API](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-service-schemas/blob/develop/openapi/workflow_execution_service.openapi.yaml). It offers functionalities for listing, creating, and deleting workflow runs. These components facilitate
seamless integration and enhanced user experience when working with WES.
