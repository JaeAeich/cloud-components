# Introduction

`@elixir-cloud/wes` package provides a collection of Web Components for interacting with 
[WES (Workflow Execution Service)](https://github.com/ga4gh/workflow-execution-service-schemas/blob/develop/openapi/workflow_execution_service.openapi.yaml). It offers functionalities for listing, creating, and deleting task runs. These components facilitate 
seamless integration and enhanced user experience when working with WES.

## Goals

<Steps>
### Extensible
This package allows to swap and replace various loosely coupled features 
of this component to support other/custom WES implmentation.

### Styling

This package allows you to style the component based on you design language and
brand identity, non programtically! via `CSS parts` and `CSS variable`.
